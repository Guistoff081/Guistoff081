## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

I believe strong software systems emerge from clarity, simplicity and long-term thinking.

My approach combines:

- Ruby-first development to build expressive and maintainable systems
- Product-oriented architecture focused on real business outcomes
- Designing for evolution — systems should grow without increasing complexity
- Developer experience as a core architectural concern
- Choosing tools intentionally to support scalability and sustainability

Software is not only about solving today's problems — it's about enabling future change without friction.
